# Add Favorites
This add-on allows you to add the currently focused web page to a folder of shortcuts, similar to how Internet Explorer handled favorites.
## Usage
1. Set the folder you want shortcuts to be added to in the add-on settings (NVDA menu, Preferences, Settings, Add favorites).
2. On any web page you want to add, press Alt+NVDA+A. Fill out the dialog and press OK.
The filename will be the title. When you hear the beep, the file is added.
## Limitations
* This add-on only supports one folder. If you want your shortcut in a subfolder, move it there manually.
A future version could walk the tree and show you a list of your folders.
* Characters in titles which are invalid in Windows filenames will be replaced with underscores.
